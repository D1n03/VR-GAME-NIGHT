Play a full game of chess in an immersive forest environment by physically grabbing and moving large pieces. Valid moves are highlighted in green directly on the board. The game manages the rules and flow, so you can focus on strategy. Captured pieces appear as small trophies on the capturing player's side.

If you're playing on a single device, the headset wearer can take turns moving both sides.

After a match, you can reset the board and start a new game at any time. You can also return to the main lobby whenever you like.
